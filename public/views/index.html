	<h2>Add a New Version</h2>
	<p>Use the form below to add a new version (e.g. after a release) to the publication cycle.</p>
	<div class="djfm-help">
		You will need 3 things for this.
		<br>
		<dl>
			<dt>A Version Number</dt>
			<dd>
				This is the PrestaShop version number, like 1.6.0.10, 1.6.1.0, etc.<br>
				The version number must be the one that is displayed in the backoffice of the prestashop version you are adding.<br>
				<div class="alert alert-warning">
					<strong>Important:</strong> This version number must <strong>NOT</strong> already be in use on Crowdin.<br>
					E.g., if you're adding a development version, check that the version number was changed. If it is the same as that of a stable version, <strong>abort</strong>.
				</div>
			</dd>
			<dt>A Version Header</dt>
			<dd>
				This is the integer id that identifies a version on translate.prestashop.com. They can be found under "PS Versions" on translate.prestashop.com.<br>
				To get a version header for a new version, you need to first add the version on translate.prestashop.com.<br>
				You need to add a version using the so called "by hand method", see the form on translate.prestashop.com.
			</dd>
			<dt>A ZIP Archive</dt>
			<dd>
				This is just a ZIP of PrestaShop. The PrestaShop inside must be in a folder called "prestashop".<br>
				It must have the admin and install folders named in a standard way: either admin or admin-dev, either install or install-dev.<br>
				When publishing a development version of PrestaShop, you need to zip the folder with git initialized, with everything set to track the branches you intend to use.<br>
				E.g.: prestashop on branch "release", all submodules on branch "master"
